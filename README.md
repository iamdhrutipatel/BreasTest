# Breasttest - Breast Cancer PredictionüéóÔ∏è
This repository contains 2 colab files üóÇÔ∏è that trains the model to predict whether it is Malignant diagnosis or Benign diagnosis by using the supervised machine learning techniques and neural network techniques. This uses 3 different algorithms of Machine Learning:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Artifical Neural Network

## Libraries Used
Libraries used in this project are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Installation Setup
<b> 1. Clone the repository </b>
You can clone this repository using command: ``https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest.git``
<br>
<b> 2. Open ``#`` </b> 
You can open the ``.ipynb`` file using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook <br><br>
Don't have **Jupyter Notebook**? Don't worry, run the following commands and you're good to go üöÄ <br>
> **$ pip install notebook** <br>
> **$ jupyter notebook**
<br>
<b> 3. Execute all the cells consecutively to see the accurecy of all model and the graphical reprentaion of the data. </b> 
<br>
<b> 4. After fireing the queries, at the end of all the algorithms we will be able to predict if the diagnosis is malignant or benign. </b> 

## Results
The least square method was used to estimate the model, and the following Minitab results were obtained.
Algorithm | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 96.49%
Random Forest | 96.49%
Artifical Neural Network | 98.36%
Final Logistic Regression | 95.56%

<b>Final Logistic Regression is the model which I've trained after finding the best parameters to train the model.</b>
