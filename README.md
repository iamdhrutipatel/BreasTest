# Breasttest - Breast Cancer PredictionüéóÔ∏è
This repository contains 2 colab files üóÇÔ∏è that trains the model to predict whether it is Malignant diagnosis or Benign diagnosis by using the supervised machine learning techniques and neural network techniques. This uses 3 different algorithms of Machine Learning:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Artifical Neural Network

## Libraries Used
Libraries used in this project are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Installation Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository
You can clone this repository using command: ``git clone https://github.com/Jimmy5467/Second-hand-car-price-prediction.git``
#### 2. Open ``Car_value_kaggle.ipynb``
You can open the ``.ipynb`` file using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook <br><br>
Don't have **Jupyter Notebook**? Don't worry, run the following commands and you're good to go üöÄ <br>
> **$ pip install notebook** <br>
> **$ jupyter notebook**
#### 3. Execute all the cells consecutively to see the accurecy of all model and the graphical reprentaion of the data.
#### 4. After fireing the queries, at the end of all the algorithms we will get the price of the selected car.

## Results
The least square method was used to estimate the model, and the following Minitab results were obtained.
R - Square Value | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Linear Regression | 83.67%
Na√Øve Bayes | 88.68%
Random Forest | 89.01%
