# Breasttest - Breast Cancer PredictionüéóÔ∏è
This repository contains 2 colab files üóÇÔ∏è that trains the model to predict whether it is a Malignant diagnosis or Benign diagnosis by using the supervised machine learning techniques and neural network techniques. This uses 3 different algorithms of Machine Learning:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Artifical Neural Network

## Explanation of the Project
- First, I've trained my model with artifical neural network to predict, if it is a benign diagnosis or malignant diagnosis. In that learned so many things like how to deal with missing values or categorical values, etc.

- Second, I've trained the model with logstic regression and random forest algorithms. Also, have done randomized search to find the best parameters to train the model.

- The Dataset I've used to train my models is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

- To find artifical neural network trained model follow this [link](https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Prediction_ANN.ipynb).

- To find logistic regression and random forest trained model follow this [link](https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Prediction_LR_RF.ipynb).
  
## Libraries Used
Libraries used in this project are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Installation Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository
You can clone this repository using command: ``https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest.git``

#### 2. Open ``Breast_Cancer_Prediction_ANN.ipynb`` ``Breast_Cancer_Prediction_LR_RF.ipynb``
You can open the ``.ipynb`` file using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Don't have **Jupyter Notebook**? Don't worry, run the following commands and you're good to go üöÄ 
> **$ pip install notebook** <br>
> **$ jupyter notebook**<br>

#### 3. Execute all the cells consecutively to see the accurecy of all model and the graphical reprentaion of the data.

#### 4. After fireing the queries, at the end of all the algorithms we will be able to predict if the diagnosis is malignant or benign.

## Results
The least square method was used to estimate the model, and the following Minitab results were obtained.
Algorithm | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 96.49%
Random Forest | 96.49%
Artifical Neural Network | 98.36%
Final Logistic Regression | 95.56%

<b>Final Logistic Regression is the model which I've trained after finding the best parameters to train the model.</b>
